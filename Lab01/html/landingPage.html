        Hi there! My full name is David Santiago Barreto Mora, I’m 19 (soon to be 20 tho) and I’m currently going
        through my undergraduate studies @Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. As of writing, I’m doing my 6th semester of
        the degree. In general, I like videogames, philosophy, astronomy, art and self improvement. That’s my formal
        boring introduction.

        Rather than talking about trivial stuff, I find it much more interesting to talk about ideas and meaning; that’s
        a big part of why I like philosophy. It promotes deep thinking about supposedly simple ideas that most of the
        time are taken for granted. Not only that, but I fucking love that good argumentation and writing is an esential
        part of the discipline. You have to come up with logically-woven ideas and deep arguments in an otherwise
        shallow world. I also guess that’s why I don’t like small talk. Doesn’t help at all that I’m mostly introverted
        and social life has never been easy for me, but the triviality, along with the almost formulaic routinariety of
        it.
