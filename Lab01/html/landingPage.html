            Hi there! My full name is David Santiago Barreto Mora, I’m 19 (soon to be 20 tho) and I’m currently going
            through my undergraduate studies @Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. As of writing, I’m doing my 6th semester of
            the degree. In general, I like videogames, philosophy, astronomy, art and self improvement. That’s my formal
            boring introduction.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rather than talking about trivial stuff, I find it much more interesting to talk about ideas and meaning; that’s
            a big part of why I like philosophy. It promotes deep thinking about supposedly simple ideas that most of the
            time are taken for granted. Not only that, but I fucking love that good argumentation and writing is an esential
            part of the discipline. You have to come up with logically-woven ideas and deep arguments in an otherwise
            shallow world. I also guess that’s why I don’t like small talk. Doesn’t help at all that I’m mostly introverted
            and social life has never been easy for me, but the triviality, along with the almost formulaic routinariety of
            it.
        </p>

            The phoenix? that's my personal symbology. You can infer why the election of the bird, but to me 
            it goes deeper than that.
